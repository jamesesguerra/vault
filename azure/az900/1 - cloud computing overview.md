**cloud computing** is the delivery of computing services over the internet. computing services include IT infrastructure such as VMs, storage, DBs, and networking. but 2 main compute services are **compute power** and **storage**.

## benefits
1. **(your) agility** - you can make decisions/change your mind quickly about purchasing / deleting compute / storage as opposed to planning ahead with on premises; infrastructure can change on demand as your needs change
2. **(your app’s) agility** - your app can change its mind quickly and decide to scale up / down depending on the workload
3. **high availability** - your service can run on different availability zones over many regions
4. **disaster recovery** - you can asynchronously replicate
5. **scalability** - scale to a certain amount only when you need it

**note** - agility is deploying new apps and services quickly, scalability is meeting demand over time, elasticity is meeting demand in sudden surges / spikes

## capex, opex, consumption-based
- **capex** - one-time purchase; purchasing an asset upfront = on prem
- **opex** - spending money over time; purchasing asset as we use it = cloud
- **consumption-based** - only pay for what you’re using/consuming 

| opex                                                         | capex                                           |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| short term assets used primarily for day-to-day business operations | long-term assets with value lasting over a year |
| easily reversible                                            | not easily reversible                           |
| usually spent in smaller quantities than capex               | usually spent in larger quantities than opex    |

### benefits of opex
- no need to worry about overestimating/underestimating resources to buy
- the ability to pay for more resources when you need it
- the ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed
- **opex = pay-as-you-go pricing** - helps you plan & manage your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change

> **main idea:** renting someone else’s CPU and storage for the time that you need them
