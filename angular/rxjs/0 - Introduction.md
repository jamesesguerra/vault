**Reactive programming** is a new way of building apps where your app will react to changes and handle data streams rather than having to write each handler separately

**RxJS** is a library that helps us making asynchronous calls and implement callback mechanisms easily with callbacks

It contains 3 main things that helps us update our data streams
- Observables
- Satellite Types - Observers, Schedulers, Subjects
- Operators - array methods (map, filter)

### Observable
An **observable** is a continuous data stream i.e. data that's continuously changing e.g. an order status. 

### Subscriber
A **subscriber** listens to an Observable for data changes / updates
