### Section 1.1
1. **What is the difference between a host and an end system? List several types of end systems. Is a Web server an end system?**
- The difference between them is that a host hosts Internet applications to other hosts, but they're also considered end systems as they sit at the edge / end of the Internet. Some examples include personal computers, laptops, and mobile phones. A Web server is an end system as well.

2. **The word *protocol* is often used to describe diplomatic relations. How does Wikipedia describe diplomatic protocol?**
- Wikipedia defines it as *"a rule that describes how an activity should be performed"* and *"the etiquette of diplomacy and affairs of state"*

3. **Why are standards important for protocols?**
- Standards are important for protocols so that different network devices can talk to each other regardless of their manufacturer.

### Section 1.2

1. **List six access technologies. Classify each one as home access, enterprise access, or wide-area wireless access.**
- Six examples of access technologies are Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), cable access (HFC), fiber to the home (FTTH), satellite, ethernet / WiFi, and 3G and LTE. Of these technologies, DSL, HFC, FTTH, and satellite are home access, ethernet / WiFi are enterprise access, and 3G and LTE are wide-area technologies.

2. **Is HFC transmission rate dedicated or shared among users? Are collisions possible in a downstream HFC channel? Why or why not?**
- HFC transmission rate is shared among users. This is because they share the same downstream and upstream channels. This is also why collisions are possible in an HFC setup.

3. **What is the transmission rate of Ethernet LANs?**
- 10Mbps to 10Gbps

4. **What are some of the physical media that Ethernet can run over?**
- Ethernet can run over copper wire (coaxial or twisted pair) and fiber. But the more common medium is copper wire.
