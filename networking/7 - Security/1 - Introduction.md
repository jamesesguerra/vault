**Network security** is the process of having two hosts communicate securely.  For example, 2 lovers Alice and Bob would want a secure communication especially if it's a love affair.

#### Characteristics
**Confidentiality**
- only the sender and receiver should be able to interpret the message
- the transmitted message must somehow be encrypted in the case of eavesdroppers
- cryptographic techniques are needed

**Integrity**
- sender and receiver wants to be sure that the content of their communication isn't altered, either maliciously or by accient
- checksumming methods similar to L2 and L4 are used

**Authentication**
- both parties have to be able to confirm who they're talking to is who or what they claim to be

**Operational Security**
- operational devices must be in place to protect against the public Internet
- examples include firewalls and intrusion detection systems that performs deep packet inspection

#### Intruders
Intruders can either eavesdrop on messages or modify messages in some way. If an intruder could actively interfere with DNS lookups, routing computations, or network management functions, it could wreak havoc on the Internet.
