#### Coding interview techniques
- [https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-techniques/](Coding inteview techniques)


1. Read the problem twice
2. Figure out the data structure required to solve the problem + any auxiliary data structure/s
3. Think of different way to solve the problems ie what kind of problem is it
	- sliding window
	- two pointers
	- pre-computation
	- divide & conquer
	- greedy
	- dynamic programming
4. Think of end-to-end solutions including brute-force ones if you can't think of any
5. Throw general techniques at it
	- see if sorting will make the problem easier + binary search
	- see if approaching the sequence from the end will make it easier
	- see if reversing will make it easier
	- make use of variables already given
	- clarify the input (duplicates, empty sequences, sequences with 1 element)
	- use a hash map for storing some piece of information
6. Draw it out
7. Code it out
8. Improve time and space complexity
