#### Inserting Data
There are several statements you can use to insert data into tables

**INSERT VALUES**
You can use this to insert rows into a table based on specified values

```sql
INSERT INTO dbo.Orders(orderid, orderdate, empid, custid)
VALUES(10001, '20240212', 3, 'A');
```

Specifying the columns after the table name is optional. But by doing so, you can control the order of the values that you use in the `VALUES` part. If you don't specify the columns, the order that will be used is the order used in the `CREATE TABLE` statement.

You can also use a standard `VALUES` clause to insert multiple values at a time. This is considered as 1 transaction ie if one of the inserts fail, none of the rows get inserted.

```sql
INSERT INTO [dbo].[Orders](orderid, orderdate, empid, custid)
VALUES
	(10001, '20240212', 3, 'B'),
	(10001, '20240212', 3, 'C'),
	(10001, '20240212', 3, 'D');
```

**INSERT SELECT**
`INSERT SELECT` is like `INSERT VALUES` except you use a SELECT statement to specify what rows you want to add to a target table. The rows returned will be the ones inserted. A similar statement is `SELECT INTO` which is just like `INSERT SELECT` except the table being inserted to hasn't been created yet.

```sql
INSERT INTO [dbo].[Orders](orderid, orderdate, empid, custid)
SELECT orderid, orderdate, empid, custid
FROM [Sales].[Orders]
WHERE shipcountry = N'UK';
```

**INSERT EXEC**
Once again, this is similar to both `INSERT SELECT` and `INSERT VALUES`, except you use a stored procedure to return the rows you want to add.

```sql
INSERT INTO [dbo].[Orders]
EXEC Sales.GetOrders @country = N'France'
```

**BULK INSERT**
This statement inserts data coming from a file into a table.


#### Generating numeric keys
SQL Server supports two ways you can automatically generate numeric keys: the identity column property and the sequence object.

**IDENTITY**
Identity is a column property used to generate surrogate keys ie keys that don't come from any business rule. You can add them to any numeric column that has no fraction. You can also add a seed, which is a starting value, and an increment number. Adding neither defaults both to 1.

When you add this property to a column, you shouldn't specify a value for it in `INSERT` statements.

```sql
CREATE TABLE dbo.T1
(
	keycol INT NOT NULL IDENTITY(1, 1)
);
```

You can also refer to the identity column of a table with `$identity`
```sql
SELECT $identity FROM dbo.T1
```

You can also grab the most recently used identity values generated by the session. This is useful for example if you want to add child rows to a referencing table.

Use `@@identity` if you don't care about scope, and `SCOPE_IDENTITY` if you do.

```sql
INSERT INTO [dbo].[T1](datacol)
VALUES('AAAAA');

SELECT SCOPE_IDENTITY();
```

But if you want the last generated identity regardless of the session, use `IDENT_CURRENT` and provide the table name as input.

```sql
SELECT IDENT_CURRENT('dbo.T1')
```

Some of the shortcomings of the identity property is that regardless of whether the transaction was successful or not, the scope identity gets incremented anyway. Also, removing / adding this property to already existing columns is cumbersome. Moreover, you can only insert by specifying the `IDENTITY_INSERT` to on, but you cannot update the values.

**Sequence**
A sequence is a more flexible way of generating numeric keys. One of the advantages is that they're not tied to a specific column, and so when you want a new key, you just invoke a function against the value.

The minimum required value is just the name of the sequence, and it will assume the defaults.
```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE dbo.SeqOrderIDS;
```

You can specify the data type, but its default value is `BIGINT`
```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE dbo.SeqOrderIDS AS INT;
```

You can also specify a minimum and maximum value, but the default is the range of the data type used. It also supports cycling, but you have to be explicit about it
```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE dbo.SeqOrderIDS 
	MINVALUE 1
	MAXVALUE 10
	CYCLE;
```

Like the identity property, you can specify a starting value and an increment. But its defaults are equal to `MINVALUE`
```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE dbo.SeqOrderIDS
	START WITH 1
	INCREMENT BY 1;
```

And to generate a new value from the sequence, you invoke the standard function `NEXT VALUE FOR`
```sql
SELECT NEXT VALUE FOR dbo.SeqOrderIDS;
```
