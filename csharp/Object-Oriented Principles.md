**1. Encapsulation** - combining data (fields) and the operations on that data (methods) into a well defined-unit (a class)
**2. Information Hiding** - only the object itself should directly access its data
**3. Abstraction** - the outside world doesn't need to know each object or class's inner workings and can deal with it as an abstract concept. It allows the inner workings to change without affecting the outside world.
**4. Inheritance** - basing one class on another, retaining the original class's functionality while extending it with additional capabilities
